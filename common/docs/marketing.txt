As I started using some popular physics engines, I wondered why their APIs were so difficult. They require things done in a very strict, and oft-times non-intuitive order, and to break that order down requires about n-thousand lines of linear and tree-based asynchronous queues, locks, fdsadfsdfsdfsdf. Then you need a nice API to sit on top of that mess. That's what Quickphyx does. It make physics simulation so easy, you wonder why nobody's done it before.

QuickPhyx, bringing DOM paradigms to physics simulation.

Style your world with CSS-like property flows. Handle events with DOM-style event listeners. Add/remove

Physics...simplified.

The physics API you've always wanted, without even knowing it.

What You Expect Is What You Get  WYEIWYG



...which brings hierarchical object management, a css-inspired property system, and dom-style events
