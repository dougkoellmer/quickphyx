This folder contains classes, settings, and runtime utilities to help developers debug issues with their simulation, and for the most part nothing in here should be used in a release version.

The debug GUI suite requires the Minimal Comps (http://www.minimalcomps.com/) library by Keith Peters, cause I didn't want to reinvent the wheel.
