The spirit of the classes in this folder is to let artists not only create the graphics for your games, but enable them to define the collision shapes and physics properties at the same time.

qb2FlashLoader takes assets produced in Flash CSx, and parses them both graphically and physics-wise for use in your game.

The loaders.proxies folder contains a bunch of classes that you use to define physics objects graphically in Flash CSx.  They all extend from MovieClip, and all use the component framework to define properties.
